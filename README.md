# The advent of code solutions

All the solutions are located inside [the tests folder](./tests)
> Solutions are not perfect, I just try to code them rapidly
> On a second thought, solutions are really bad xD

## My workflow

I use NeoVim to edit the codes. I use `yarn test:watch` command to test the code on each change
